News website to practice CSS grid, Sass, media queries, responsive images and JavaScript.

## CSS Features
-	I deliberately chose to implement a difficult layout in order to improve my knowledge of CSS grid.
-	Designed the website myself.
-	Sass used to keep code dry and accelerate the development process.
-	Fully responsive with media queries that make use of Sass conditionals.
-	Responsive images with srcset

## JavaScript Features
-	**Includes an example of a program I wrote which automates the process of responsive images** The live example is in this repository and will work when you load the index.html file. The development of the program is in a [separate repository](https://github.com/chrisenoch/automatic-image-resize), where you can find the documentation as well as an additional program which resizes images in bulk.
-	Hamburger navigation menu
